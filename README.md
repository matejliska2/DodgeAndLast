# Dodge And Last
## A 2d game about dodging particles. Try to stay alive as long as you can.

This project is made in Java.

When you get into the game there is a Menu that lets you choose between "Help" which explains how the gmae is played and how it works. "Quit" lets you quit the game and finally "Play" which starts your game putting you in the center of the screen as a rectangle player that goes from level one farming score and trying to stay alive.

## With each level the difficulty increases

Of course with the rising score and level the enemies are spawned more frequently and sometimes a harder one will spawn.

Every 10 levels there is a different boss waiting for you.

Enjoy
